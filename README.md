# Morse + Wavenet Starter Code  

This is a text-to-speech (TTS) app that converts written text into spoken word. What makes this example Morse-compatible is that it allows folks to activate the voice with a unique Morse sequence. 

This experiment uses Google’s ML-powered [Cloud Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/) which enables developers to synthesize natural-sounding speech with many voice options made possible via WaveNet from DeepMind.  

This experiment is part of a larger project to support Morse code for more accessible communication. Learn more at [g.co/morse](http://g.co/morse)

Built using Wavenet and Google Cloud Speech API
